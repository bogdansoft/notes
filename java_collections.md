## Collections
#### Counting Elements for List
The isEmpty() and size() methods look at how many elements are in the Collection. The 
method signatures are as follows:
public boolean isEmpty()
public int size()
The following shows how to use these methods:
Collection<String> birds = new ArrayList<>();
System.out.println(birds.isEmpty()); // true
System.out.println(birds.size()); // 0
