#### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself 
+ Avoid Duplication in Comments of code
+ Avoid DATA/logic-based duplication
+ Avoid Algorithm duplication

#### KISS Principle - Keep it Simple, Stupid 

Few ways by which a programmer can reduce complexity:
+ The variable names in a program should serve their purpose well. They should be able to define the variable properly
+ Method name should also be in line with the purpose for which the method is employed
+ As mentioned in an earlier example in the DRY principle, comments in the method should be used only when your program is not able to define the method completely
+ Classes should be designed in a way to own a single responsibility
+ Delete redundant processes and algorithms as explained during the DRY process
