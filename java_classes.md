## Java Classes
#### Class Modifiers
Modifier | Description 
--- | ---
final | The class may not be extended. 
abstract | The class is abstract, may contain abstract methods, and requires a concrete subclass to instantiate.
sealed | The class may only be extended by a specific list of classes.
non-sealed | A subclass of a sealed class permits potentially unnamed subclasses.
static | Used for static nested classes defined within a class. 

Trying to declare a top-level class with protected or private class will lead to a compiler error, though:
```
// ClownFish.java
protected class ClownFish{} // DOES NOT COMPILE
// BlueTang.java
private class BlueTang {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
#### Accessing the this Reference
```
public class Flamingo {
 private String color = null;
 public void setColor(String color) {
 color = color;
 }
 public static void main(String... unused) {
 var f = new Flamingo();
 f.setColor("PINK");
 System.out.print(f.color);
 }
}
```
```
public void setColor(String color) {
 this.color = color; // Sets the instance variable with method parameter
 }
```
```
public class Duck {
private String color;
private int height;
private int length;

public void setData(int length, int theHeight) {
length = this.length; // Backwards -- no good!
height = theHeight; // Fine, because a different name
this.color = "white"; // Fine, but this. reference not necessary
 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Duck b = new Duck();
 b.setData(1,2);
 System.out.print(b.length + " " + b.height + " " + b.color);//0 2 white
} }
```
#### Calling the super Reference

```
class Insect {
    protected int numberOfLegs = 4;
    String label = "buggy";
}

 class Beetle extends Insect {
    protected int numberOfLegs = 6;
    short age = 3;

    public void printData() {
        System.out.println(this.label);//buggy
        System.out.println(super.label);//buggy
        System.out.println(this.age);//3
        System.out.println(super.age);//DOES NOT COMPILE
        System.out.println(numberOfLegs);//6
    }
     public static void main(String[] n) {
         new Beetle().printData();
     }
}
```

#### Constructor
```
public class Bunny {
 public bunny() {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
 public void Bunny() {}
 public Bunny(var food) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```
#### Constructor overloading
```
public class Turtle {
 private String name;
 public Turtle() {
 name = "John Doe";
 }
 public Turtle(int age) {}
 public Turtle(long age) {}
 public Turtle(String newName, String... favoriteFoods) {
 name = newName;
 }
}
```
**Every class in Java has a constructor, whether you code one or not. If you donâ€™t include 
any constructors in the class, Java will create one for you without any parameters.**
```
public class Rabbit4 {
 private Rabbit4() {}
}
var r4 = new Rabbit4(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
Having only **private constructors** in a class tells the compiler not to 
provide a default no-argument constructor. It also prevents other classes 
from instantiating the class. This is useful when a class has only static
methods or the developer wants to have full control of all calls to create 
new instances of the class.

#### Calling Overloaded Constructors with this()
```
public class Hamster {
 private String color;
 private int weight;
 public Hamster(int weight, String color) { // First constructor
 this.weight = weight;
 this.color = color;
 }
 public Hamster(int weight) { // Second constructor
 this.weight = weight;
 color = "brown";
 }
 public Hamster(int weight) { // Second constructor
 Hamster(weight, "brown"); // DOES NOT COMPILE
 }
 public Hamster(int weight) { // Second constructor
 new Hamster(weight, "brown"); // Compiles, but creates an extra object
 }
 
 //Solution
 public Hamster(int weight) { // Second constructor
 this(weight, "brown");
 }
}
```
#### this vs. this()
Despite using the same keyword, this and this() are very different. The first, this, 
refers to an instance of the class, while the second, this(), refers to a constructor call 
within the class.

Calling this() has one special rule you need to know. If you choose to call it, the this() call 
must be the first statement in the constructor. The side effect of this is that there can be only 
one call to this() in any constructor.
```
public Hamster(int weight) {
System.out.println("chew");
// Set weight and default color
this(weight, "brown"); // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```
Rules:
- A class can contain many overloaded constructors, provided the signature for each 
is distinct.
- The compiler inserts a default no-argument constructor if no constructors are declared.
- If a constructor calls this(), then it must be the first line of the constructor.
- Java does not allow cyclic constructor calls.
