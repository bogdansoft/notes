## Lambdas and Functional Interfaces

#### Assigning Lambdas to var
```
var invalid = (Animal a) -> a.canHop(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
var assumes the type based on the context as well. Thereâ€™s not enough context here! Neither the lambda nor var have enough information to determine what type of 
functional interface should be used.
