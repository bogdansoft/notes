## Lambdas and Functional Interfaces

#### Assigning Lambdas to var
```
var invalid = (Animal a) -> a.canHop(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
var assumes the type based on the context as well. Thereâ€™s not enough context here! Neither the lambda nor var have enough information to determine what type of 
functional interface should be used.
Is the Soar class a functional interface?
```
@FunctionalInterface//DOES NOT COMPILE
public interface Soar {
 abstract String toString();
}
```
It is not. Since toString() is a public method implemented in Object, it does not 
count toward the single abstract method test. On the other hand, the following implementation of Dive is a functional interface:
```
@FunctionalInterface//COMPILE
public interface Dive {
 String toString();
 public boolean equals(Object o);
 public abstract int hashCode();
 public void dive();
}
```
The dive() method is the single abstract method, while the others are not counted since they are public methods defined in the Object class.
